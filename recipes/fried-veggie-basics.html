    <h2>I'm about to show you non-cookies (like myself) how easy it is to eat a healthy and tasty meal. Too simple...</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Veggies of your choosing that'll fit in a frying pan (carrots, green beans, corn, tomatoe, onion, peppers, etc)</li>
        <li> A tbsp of your favorite BBQ Sauce</li>
        <li> Salt</li>
        <li> Your choice of Butter, Margarine or cooking Oil</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h3>Things you'll need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Stove Top</li>
        <li>Frying Pan</li>
        <li>Spactula</li>

    </ul>
    <h3><em><u>Instructions:</u></em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Heat up stove top (I would recommend starting with your stove top dial just under the half-way point and then figure out later if you need more heat). </li>
        <li> Place the desired amount of oil/butter you want to cook with (less it better to start with and then increase if things are sticking to the pan). Then let that butter/oil heat briefly.</li>
        <li> Place your selected portion of veggies onto the pan.</li>
        <li> Cook your veggies to your desired doing (I personally like it when my veggies have some very slight burn to them)</li>
        <li> Once cooked, serve 'em and eat 'em.</li>
    </ol>
