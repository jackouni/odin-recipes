# odin-recipes
My first project creating a simple a webpage showcasing recipes I cook up.

I am currently working through the ODIN Project, a free resource that allows people to make their way through the fundamentals of web development. Currently I have just finished learning the basics of HTML and have encountered my first "project" in the course.

The aim of the project is to create a site using only HTML (for now) showcasing some of my favorite recipes.
